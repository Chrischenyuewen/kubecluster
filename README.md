### The kubecluster implements a mechanism that makes it easy to build Slurm/Torque clusters on Kubernetes.

## Features
Kubecluster uses Pods to simulate nodes in different clusters, currently supports the following cluster types :

- [Slurm](pkg/controller/slurm_schema)
- [Torque( PBS )](pkg/controller/torque_schema)
## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

## Installation

### Master Branch

```bash
kubectl apply -k "github.com/chriskery/kubecluster/manifests/default"
```

## Quick Start

Please refer to the [quick-start.md](docs/quick-start.md) and [Kubeflow Training User Guide](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/guides/components/tftraining/) for more information.


### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/).

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/),
which provide a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources until the desired state is reached on the cluster.

### Test It Out
1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
